The _EMF Builder Generator_ project helps with generating "Java builders":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern for EMF metamodels. The generated Java classes follow a fluent API. Builders are very useful to create test data, but can also be used to construct object graphs in production code.

In a nutshell, instead of writing:

<pre>
Company company = CompanyFactory.eINSTANCE.createCompany();
company.setName("MyCompany");

Department department = CompanyFactory.eINSTANCE.createDepartment();
department.setNumber(1);

Employee alice = CompanyFactory.eINSTANCE.createEmployee();
alice.setName("Alice");

Employee bob = CompanyFactory.eINSTANCE.createEmployee();
bob.setName("Bob");

department.getEmployees().add(alice);
department.getEmployees().add(bob);
company.getDepartment().add(department);
</pre>

you now can write:

<pre>
Company company = newCompanyBuilder()
  .withName("MyCompany")
  .withDepartment(
    newDepartmentBuilder()
      .withNumber(1)
      .withEmployees(
        newEmployeeBuilder()
          .withName("Alice")
      )
      .withEmployees(
        newEmployeeBuilder()
          .withName("Bob"))
      )
  .build();
</pre>
